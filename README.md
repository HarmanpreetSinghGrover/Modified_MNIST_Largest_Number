# Modified-Mnist
This includes all code for mini project 3.

Task:
You must design and validate a supervised classification model to perform the Modified MNIST prediction task. There are no restrictions on your model, except that it should be written in Python. As with the previous mini-projects, you must write a report about your approach, so you should develop a coherent validation pipeline and ideally provide justification/motivation for your design decisions. You are free to develop a single model or to use an ensemble; there are no hard restrictions.
